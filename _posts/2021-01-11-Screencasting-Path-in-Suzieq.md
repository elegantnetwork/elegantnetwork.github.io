title: Screencasting Path in Suzieq
excerpt: A screencast demonstrating path tracing in Suzieq
description: Two screencasts show off how path trace in Suzieq helps troubleshoot problems

A new year, a new medium. 

One of the fringe benefits of choosing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is that it natively supports creating screencasts. For me, a toddler at best when it comes creating video content (my dad is better than I am at this), this was a useful feature as it allowed me to effortlessly record the first screencasts of Suzieq. 

Suzieq has always had the ability to show all the paths between a source and destination. We wanted the GUI to be not something that merely mimic'd the CLI, but took advantage of the visual layout to help network operators better understand what's going on in their networks. We wanted operators to be able to troubeshoot problems they found with Suzieq as much as possible in the GUI itself, more easily than typing a bunch of commands. 

[![Introducing Path in Suzieq](/assets/images/2021-01-11/mq2.jpp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wZot1FBmrQ "Introducing Path in Suzieq"), the first video explains how path trace works in Suzieq, and how to make sense of the output in the GUI. 

The [![second video](/assets/images/2021-01-11/mq1.jpp))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaCANwgUP3Y "Troubleshooting Example with Suzieq Path") goes deeper by taking a problem encountered in the first video and using the Suzieq GUI to figure out what the problem is. 

Please let us know if you found the videos useful, and if you'd like to see more of these kinds of videos illustrating the use of Suzieq.
