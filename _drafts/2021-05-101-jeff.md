title: Jeff is a Network Architect who needs better network tools

A journey into improving the operations of a working network.

Jeff is a senior network architect who understands the role of software in network operations. As an architect in his company, he is in meetings with other architects and senior managers across IT. He's noticed that the network has an outsized role on the ability of the company to deliver on IT projects and on the ability of the company to be available for customers. If the network is down, everything is down. If the network is late on a projects, it affects many teams.

His major focus is datacenter networks. In his thinking about delivering projects and operating the networking, he realized he needs better understanding and insight into his network and to operational changes.

His current network monitoring is adequate. His team gets notified when devices or interfaces go down. They have a dashboard that tells them when something is down. For the most part they rely on their customers to tell them that something bad has happened and when that happens they can look at the dashboards to see if anything is down that shouldn't be. The monitoring also allows them to investigate traffic issues and see if there is congestion and packet loss when somebody complains about slowness. But he realizes they want to be more proactive. 

He starts looking into outages and sees (as expected) that most of the outages are triggered by changes to the network, just like every other network.


He notices that other parts of IT don't trust the networking team. There are many reasons, some of them are that the Networking teams uses so many weird acronyms. Also, they don't explain themselves well. And the problem is always the network. Well, the other teams don't know how to know if the network is the problem or not. A compute person knows how to at least get started on looking at a database or storage system, but the network is opaque.

## where to get started

### Validation



### better troubleshooting tools



### taking responsibility to know the network is broken
