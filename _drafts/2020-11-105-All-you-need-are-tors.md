DEATH to Chassis Routers!

When almost everyone builds a datacenter network, they start out with very large chassis devices. I'm here to tell you that's unnecessary and unwanted. All  you need are ToRs. I've built really really really big datacenter networks. All we needed were ToRs. 

I don't really mean all you need are Top-of-Rack switches, I mean all you need are the single ASIC switches that are traditionally considered for ToRs. You don't need (or want) large multi-chip chassis.


If you were given James' picture and had to build a network, what would you do?


Why hasn't the networking industry embraced horizontal scale like the compute industry has? It's especially ironic given the fact that networking has the protocol (distributed system) that enables scale out. However, it doesn't have the management infrastructure and tools to support this. A CCIE does not prepare you with how to managed 100K routers, or even 10K routers.

you have 10x more. now you have to automate. and monitor
