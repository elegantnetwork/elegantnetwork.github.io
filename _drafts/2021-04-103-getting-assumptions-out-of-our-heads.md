title: Geting Assumptions out of our Heads
excerpt: 
description: Too much of networking requires network engineers to keep a lot in their heads. We need to get that out.

The best network engineers I've experienced can keep a lot in their heads. Maybe it's all the OSPF state machines as well as all the LSAs and what is in them. Or when they are debugging and they run various show commands they can remember which IP was the neighbor that they need to care about.

I can't do that I can't keep ip addresses in my head.

I also think it's a very bad habbit to rely on that.

I’ve written quite a lot of abstract posts, this might be the most. 

Engineering is the art of tradeoffs. When making a decision, or even when operating on that decision, you have a set of assumptions about how those things will work.

In real engineering disciplines, those assumptions can turn into numbers, models, and equations.

In software,  you get it out in code, and you test it through tests.

In networking people are rewarded for keeping all those assumptions in their heads. I want it out. 


I think this leads to precious networking
