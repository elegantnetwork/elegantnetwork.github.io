As a side note, one of the things that discourages me about our industry is that there doesn't seem to be great overlay technology for datacenters that is readily available. This is the only way that the cloud providers succeed, but as far as I can tell, what is available for the public doesn't scale very well and/or is very complicated. Getting rid of eVPN and VLANs in datacenters, while providing overlay networks for the separation requirements, makes the network simpler, by providing the right abstraction and separate layers more cleanly. This can keep the network focused on what is required, and the overlay is usually easier to automate and test. Having an overlay is a very important design abstraction that scales well in datacenter networks.
