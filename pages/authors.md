## About Us

The two main authors of the blog posts under The Elegant Network moniker are Dinesh G Dutt and Justin Pietsch. We come together from backgrounds of operations and vendor. But we are more mixed than that. As Chief Scientist at Cumulus Networks, Dinesh worked with customers and built deployments. He's also implemented novel features in FRR to make network management easier. Justin has spent a lot of time designing networks to be more operatable, and manageable, and written some key management software at Amazon. It greatly influenced the way he thinks about network design.

**Justin Pietsch** was most recently a Principal Network Engineer at AWS. Justin's experience is largely based on this time at Amazon, 17 years (16 years, 11 months and 21 days, actually.) He focused mostly on datacenter networking and helped architect some of the largest and most scalable datacenter networks in the world. When he first started at Amazon it had a small but complicated network, over time it changes to simpler, but much larger; yet never simple enough :). He cares deeply about software systems for network engineers so that they can design, build, and operate networks well. 

**Dinesh G Dutt** is a well known industry expert and author of three very popular and well-regarded books on data center networks. His most recent work is titled Cloud Native Data Center Networking and has been published by O'Reilly. He has spent 20 years in the networking industry, first working for Cisco Systems where he started as software engineer and finished as a Cisco Fellow. His next stint--we'll leave a more famous 2 week detour out of the discussion--was as the Chief Scientist at Cumulus Networks, the company that started the network disaggregation revolution. He's passionate about networks and open source. At Cisco, he was one of the key architects behind many of Cisco's mega switches such as Catalyst 6500, MDS Storage Switches, and the Nexus 7000 and 5000 family of switches. He is the coinventor of VXLAN.
